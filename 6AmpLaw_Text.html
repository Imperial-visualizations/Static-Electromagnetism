<div id="CurrentLine" class="divclass">
    <h1> Current Wire: </h1>
    <p> Consider an infinitely long current-carrying wire. Recall the integral form of static Ampere's law</p>
    $$\oint \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} = \mu_0 I_{enclosed},$$
    <p>and construct a circular Amperian loop (Amp loop). The loop encloses the wire. The magnetic field generated by the wire is circular
    with a constant magnitude at a given distance $r$. Hence,</p>
    $$ \displaystyle \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} = |\textbf{B}||\textbf{dl}|\cos(\theta)= B dl $$
    <p> as the magnetic field aligns with the loop. The integral can be performed and equation for the magnetic field strength $B$ can be derived.</p>
    $$ \int B dl = 2\pi r B= \mu_0 I_{enclosed}. $$
    <p> Hence,</p>
    $$ B = \frac{\mu_0 I_{enclosed}}{2 \pi r}. $$
    <p> The direction in which the magnetic field rotates can be confirmed by using the Ampère's right-hand grip rule.</p>
    <p><bold> Note:</bold> The magnetic field strength falls off with distance from the wire. You can confirm this using the visualisation on the Right.</p>
</div>
<div id="solenoid" class="divclass">
    <h1> Solenoid: </h1>
    <p> A solenoid can be approximated as a series of circular loops of current with fixed separation. In this model, the solenoid is aligned
    such that we can consider the current flowing into and out of the screen. Now consider a rectangular Amperian loop (Amp loop). The Amp loop
        can be split into four straight lines. This allows the closed integral of static Ampere's law into four integral representing the four straight lines.</p>
    <p>The diagram shows this Amp loop. The length and the alignment of the sides are chosen to simplify the integral: Side $2$ and $4$ align perpendicularly to the direction of the
    magnetic field, hence $\textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} =0 $. Side $3$ is positioned at $r=\infty$, hence $|\textbf{B}|=0$.</p>
    $\displaystyle \oint \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} = \int_{a}^{b} \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} + \int_{b}^{c} \underbrace{\textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl}}_\text{=0}  + \int_{c}^{d} \underbrace{\textbf{B}}_\text{=0} \cdot \textbf{dl} + \int_{d}^{a} \underbrace{\textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl}}_\text{=0}.$
    <p> Hence, </p>
    $\displaystyle \int_{a}^{b} \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} = BL=\mu_0 I_{enclosed}=\mu_0 N I,$
    <p> where $L=b-a$, $N$ is the number of current loops enclosed in the loop, and $I$ is the current through each current loop. Rearranging gives the equation for the magnetic field strength within
    the solenoid. </p>
    $$ B = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{L}=\mu_0 n I, $$
    <p> where $n$ is the number density of the current loops, meaning the number of current loops in a unit length of the solenoid. Note that the magnetic field strength is constant within
    the solenoid. You can confirm this by using the visualisation on the right. Keep in mind that the side outside the solenoid does not go off to infinity, however you can see how quickly the
    magnetic field falls off with distance. The arrow moving around the Amp loop in the visualisation represent the resultant magnetic field's magnitude and direction, $\textbf{B}$, NOT $\textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl}$.    </p>
</div>
<div id="Toroid" class="divclass">
    <h1> Toroid : </h1>
    <p>A toroid is simply a solenoid formed into a loop ( a loop of loops!). To calculate the magnetic field strength generated, a circular Amperian loop (Amp loop) is used to evaluated
    the three regions of the toroid.</p>
    <p> Within Region A and C, the net current enclosed is zero, therefore based on static Ampere's law, $|\textbf{B}|$ the magnetic field strength is zero. Within Region B,</p>
    $\displaystyle \oint \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} = \oint Bdl = 2\pi rB = \mu_0 I_{enclosed},$
    <p> as the magnetic field within the toroid aligns with the Amp loop. Hence,</p>
    $\displaystyle B = \frac{\mu_0 I_{enclosed}}{2\pi r} = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{2\pi r} = \frac{\mu_0 (nL) I}{2\pi r},$
    <p> where $n(=N/L)$ is the number density of the current loops, $L$ is the circumference of the toroid, and $N$ is the number of current loops enclosed in the Amp loop. In the
    approximation that the radius of each current loop in the toroid is negligible compared to the radius of the Amp loop, we can assume </p>
    $\displaystyle L \approx 2 \pi r.$
    <p> Hence,</p>
    $\displaystyle B = \mu_0 n I$
    <p> which is the same equation that was derived for the solenoid. You can confirm this by using the visualisation on the right. Keep in mind that the visualisation calculates the net
    magnetic field generated at the point the arrow is. Hence there is a small variation from the theory when that approximation is not applied ( ie. the radius of the current loops is comparable to
        the radius of the Amp loop. Also note the change in the direction of the magnetic field when the Amp loop is slightly out of region B. You can confirm the direction using the Ampère's right-hand grip rule. </p>
