    <h1> Current Wire: </h1>
    <p> Consider an infinitely long current-carrying wire. Recall the integral form of static Ampere's law</p>
    $$\oint \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} = \mu_0 I_{enclosed},$$
    <p>and construct a circular Amperian loop (Amp loop). The loop encloses the wire. The magnetic field generated by
        the wire is circular
        with a constant magnitude at a given distance $r$. Hence,</p>
    $$ \displaystyle \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} = |\textbf{B}||\textbf{dl}|\cos(\theta)= B dl $$
    <p> as the magnetic field aligns with the loop. The integral can be performed and equation for the magnetic field
        strength $B$ can be derived.</p>
    $$ \int B dl = 2\pi r B= \mu_0 I_{enclosed}. $$
    <p> Hence,</p>
    $$ B = \frac{\mu_0 I_{enclosed}}{2 \pi r}. $$
    <p> The direction in which the magnetic field rotates can be confirmed by using the Ampère's right-hand grip
        rule.</p>
    <p><img src="RHrule.jpg" style="width:50%;height:20%;margin-right:5%;margin-bottom:5%;">
        The direction in which the magnetic field rotates can be confirmed by using the Ampère's right-hand
        grip rule. Note that the magnetic field strength falls off with distance from the wire. You can confirm
        this using the
        visualisation on the Right.

<div id="solenoid" class="divclass">
    <h1> Solenoid: </h1>
    <p> A solenoid can be approximated as a series of circular loops of current with fixed separation. In this model,
        the solenoid is aligned
        such that we can consider the current flowing into and out of the screen. Now consider a rectangular Amperian
        loop (Amp loop). The Amp loop
        can be split into four straight lines. This allows the closed integral of static Ampere's law into four integral
        representing the four straight lines.</p>
    <img src="Solenoid.jpg" style="width:50%;height:20%;margin-right:5%;margin-bottom:5%;"  >
    <p>The diagram shows this Amp loop. The length and the alignment of the sides are chosen to simplify the integral:
        Side $2$ and $4$ align perpendicularly to the direction of the
        magnetic field, hence $\textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} =0 $. Side $3$ is positioned at $r=\infty$, hence
        $|\textbf{B}|=0$.</p>
    $\displaystyle \oint \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} = \int_{a}^{b} \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} + \int_{b}^{c}
    \underbrace{\textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl}}_\text{=0} + \int_{c}^{d} \underbrace{\textbf{B}}_\text{=0} \cdot
    \textbf{dl} + \int_{d}^{a} \underbrace{\textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl}}_\text{=0}.$
    <p> Hence, </p>
    $\displaystyle \int_{a}^{b} \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} = BL=\mu_0 I_{enclosed}=\mu_0 N I,$
    <p> where $L=b-a$, $N$ is the number of current loops enclosed in the loop, and $I$ is the current through each
        current loop. Rearranging gives the equation for the magnetic field strength within
        the solenoid. </p>
    $$ B = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{L}=\mu_0 n I, $$
    <p> where $n$ is the number density of the current loops, meaning the number of current loops in a unit length of
        the solenoid. Note that the magnetic field strength is constant within
        the solenoid. You can confirm this by using the visualisation on the right. Keep in mind that the side outside
        the solenoid does not go off to infinity, however you can see how quickly the
        magnetic field falls off with distance. The arrow moving around the Amp loop in the visualisation represent the
        resultant magnetic field's magnitude and direction, $\textbf{B}$, NOT $\textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl}$. </p>
</div>
<div id="Toroid" class="divclass">
    <h1> Toroid : </h1>
    <p>A toroid is simply a solenoid formed into a loop ( a loop of loops!). To calculate the magnetic field strength
        generated, a circular Amperian loop (Amp loop) is used to evaluated
        the three regions of the toroid.</p>
    <p> Within Region A and C, the net current enclosed is zero, therefore based on static Ampere's law, $|\textbf{B}|$
        the magnetic field strength is zero. Within Region B,</p>
    $\displaystyle \oint \textbf{B} \cdot \textbf{dl} = \oint Bdl = 2\pi rB = \mu_0 I_{enclosed},$
    <p> as the magnetic field within the toroid aligns with the Amp loop. Hence,</p>
    $\displaystyle B = \frac{\mu_0 I_{enclosed}}{2\pi r} = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{2\pi r} = \frac{\mu_0 (nL) I}{2\pi r},$
    <p> where $n(=N/L)$ is the number density of the current loops, $L$ is the circumference of the toroid, and $N$ is
        the number of current loops enclosed in the Amp loop. In the
        approximation that the radius of each current loop in the toroid is negligible compared to the radius of the Amp
        loop, we can assume </p>
    $\displaystyle L \approx 2 \pi r.$
    <p> Hence,</p>
    $\displaystyle B = \mu_0 n I$
    <p> which is the same equation that was derived for the solenoid. You can confirm this by using the visualisation on
        the right. Keep in mind that the visualisation calculates the net
        magnetic field generated at the point the arrow is. Hence there is a small variation from the theory when that
        approximation is not applied ( ie. the radius of the current loops is comparable to
        the radius of the Amp loop. Also note the change in the direction of the magnetic field when the Amp loop is
        slightly out of region B. You can confirm the direction using the Ampère's right-hand grip rule. </p>
