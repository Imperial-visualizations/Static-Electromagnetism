        In electrostatics, all electric fields are conservative. This means that we can find out the potential difference between any two points (A and B) by performing a line integral:
        $$\Delta V_{AB} = V_B - V_A = \frac{\Delta U_{AB} }{q} = -\frac{1}{q} \int _A ^B \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{ dl } =  - \int _A ^B \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{ dl } $$

                    <li>On the right, you can see a electric field and the electric potential associated with this field.
                        Change the value of the charge, $q$, and observe the change in $\mathbf{E}$ and $V$.</li>
                    <li>As the magnitude of $q$ increases, the length of the arrows in $\mathbf{E}$ increases and the contour of the electric potential
                        $V$ becomes steeper as well. Since $\mathbf{E} = - \nabla V$, the gradient vector of $V$ is its electric field vector,
                        which points in the direction of steepest decrease of $V$.</li>
                    <li>The line integral along the electric field,
                        $\int \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{ dl }$ is path independent. Move the path of the ball from Point A to Point B
                        along 2 different paths, Path 1 and Path 2.</li>
                    <li>Observe their electric potential values. Note that along the path, the value of $V$ may be different.
                        However, when the balls reach Point B, they have the same electric potential.</li>
                    <li>This shows that static electric fields are conservative, hence $\mathbf{E}$ is only dependent on its position.</li>
                    <li>There are a few other electric fields for you to play around with. Click the dropdown menu to find out.</li>
